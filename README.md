# Upfluence OSS Component

This project hosts a bunch of branded (following the OSS framework)
components for usage in our projects.

## Running / Development

This addon's dummy app is actually a showcase of the frontend framework
and its custom components.

It's an Ember app, so we assume you have all set up as that's our
frontend stack anyway.

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Deploying

A simple `ember deploy production --verbose` will do the trick.

PS: Do not forget to set the env variables accordingly (See
`config/deploy.js` for details about needed variables).
